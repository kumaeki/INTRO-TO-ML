    "## Our Mission ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail'. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission we will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. It is important to have some level of intuition as to what a spammy text message might look like. Often they have words like 'free', 'win', 'winner', 'cash', 'prize' and the like in them as these texts are designed to catch your eye and in some sense tempt you to open them. Also, spam messages tend to have words written in all capitals and also tend to use a lot of exclamation marks. To the human recipient, it is usually pretty straightforward to identify a spam text and our objective here is to train a model to do that for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' and nothing else. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions. \n",

    "### Step 0: Introduction to the Naive Bayes Theorem ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes Theorem is one of the earliest probabilistic inference algorithms. It was developed by Reverend Bayes (which he used to try and infer the existence of God no less), and still performs extremely well for certain use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's best to understand this theorem using an example. Let's say you are a member of the Secret Service and you have been deployed to protect the Democratic presidential nominee during one of his/her campaign speeches. Being a public event that is open to all, your job is not easy and you have to be on the constant lookout for threats. So one place to start is to put a certain threat-factor for each person. So based on the features of an individual, like age, whether the person is carrying a bag, looks nervous, etc., you can make a judgment call as to whether that person is a viable threat. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an individual ticks all the boxes up to a level where it crosses a threshold of doubt in your mind, you can take action and remove that person from the vicinity. Bayes Theorem works in the same way, as we are computing the probability of an event (a person being a threat) based on the probabilities of certain related events (age, presence of bag or not, nervousness of the person, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to consider is the independence of these features amongst each other. For example if a child looks nervous at the event then the likelihood of that person being a threat is not as much as say if it was a grown man who was nervous. To break this down a bit further, here there are two features we are considering, age AND nervousness. Say we look at these features individually, we could design a model that flags ALL persons that are nervous as potential threats. However, it is likely that we will have a lot of false positives as there is a strong chance that minors present at the event will be nervous. Hence by considering the age of a person along with the 'nervousness' feature we would definitely get a more accurate result as to who are potential threats and who aren't. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the 'Naive' bit of the theorem where it considers each feature to be independent of each other which may not always be the case and hence that can affect the final judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, Bayes Theorem calculates the probability of a certain event happening (in our case, a message being spam) based on the joint probabilistic distributions of certain other events (in our case, the appearance of certain words in a message). We will dive into the workings of Bayes Theorem later in the mission, but first, let us understand the data we are going to work with."

    "Here we'd like to introduce the Bag of Words (BoW) concept which is a term used to specify the problems that have a 'bag of words' or a collection of text data that needs to be worked with. The basic idea of BoW is to take a piece of text and count the frequency of the words in that text. It is important to note that the BoW concept treats each word individually and the order in which the words occur does not matter. \n",

    "Using a process which we will go through now, we can convert a collection of documents to a matrix, with each document being a row and each word (token) being the column, and the corresponding (row, column) values being the frequency of occurrence of each word or token in that document.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have 4 documents, which are text messages\n",
    "in our case, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`['Hello, how are you!',\n",
    "'Win money, win from home.',\n",
    "'Call me now',\n",
    "'Hello, Call you tomorrow?']`\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/countvectorizer.png\" height=\"542\" width=\"542\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here as we can see, the documents are numbered in the rows, and each word is a column name, with the corresponding value being the frequency of that word in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break this down and see how we can do this conversion using a small set of documents.\n",

    "[count vectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer) method which does the following:\n",

    "* It tokenizes the string (separates the string into individual words) and gives an integer ID to each token.\n",
    "* It counts the occurrence of each of those tokens.\n",

    "**Please Note:** \n",
    "\n",
    "* The CountVectorizer method automatically converts all tokenized words to their lower case form so that it does not treat words like 'He' and 'he' differently. It does this using the `lowercase` parameter which is by default set to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It also ignores all punctuation so that words followed by a punctuation mark (for example: 'hello!') are not treated differently than the same words not prefixed or suffixed by a punctuation mark (for example: 'hello'). It does this using the `token_pattern` parameter which has a default regular expression which selects tokens of 2 or more alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The third parameter to take note of is the `stop_words` parameter. Stop words refer to the most commonly used words in a language. They include words like 'am', 'an', 'and', 'the', etc. By setting this parameter value to `english`, CountVectorizer will automatically ignore all words (from our input text) that are found in the built in list of English stop words in scikit-learn. This is extremely helpful as stop words can skew our calculations when we are trying to find certain key words that are indicative of spam.\n",
    "\n",

    "Now that we have our dataset in the format that we need, we can move onto the next portion of our mission which is the  algorithm we will use to make our predictions to classify a message as spam or not spam. Remember that at the start of the mission we briefly discussed the Bayes theorem but now we shall go into a little more detail. In layman's terms, the Bayes theorem calculates the probability of an event occurring, based on certain other probabilities that are related to the event in question. It is composed of \"prior probabilities\" - or just \"priors.\" These \"priors\" are the probabilities that we are aware of, or that are given to us. And Bayes theorem is also composed of the \"posterior probabilities,\" or just \"posteriors,\" which are the probabilities we are looking to compute using the \"priors\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us implement the Bayes Theorem from scratch using a simple example. Let's say we are trying to find the odds of an individual having diabetes, given that he or she was tested for it and got a positive result. \n",
    "In the medical field, such probabilities play a very important role as they often deal with life and death situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We assume the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`P(D)` is the probability of a person having Diabetes. Its value is `0.01`, or in other words, 1% of the general population has diabetes (disclaimer: these values are assumptions and are not reflective of any actual medical study).\n",
    "\n",
    "`P(Pos)` is the probability of getting a positive test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "`P(Neg)` is the probability of getting a negative test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "`P(Pos|D)` is the probability of getting a positive result on a test done for detecting diabetes, given that you have diabetes. This has a value `0.9`. In other words the test is correct 90% of the time. This is also called the Sensitivity or True Positive Rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "`P(Neg|~D)` is the probability of getting a negative result on a test done for detecting diabetes, given that you do not have diabetes. This also has a value of `0.9` and is therefore correct, 90% of the time. This is also called the Specificity or True Negative Rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayes formula is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bayes_formula.png\" height=\"242\" width=\"242\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* `P(A)` is the prior probability of A occurring independently. In our example this is `P(D)`. This value is given to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `P(B)` is the prior probability of B occurring independently. In our example this is `P(Pos)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `P(A|B)` is the posterior probability that A occurs given B. In our example this is `P(D|Pos)`. That is, **the probability of an individual having diabetes, given that this individual got a positive test result. This is the value that we are looking to calculate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `P(B|A)` is the prior probability of B occurring, given A. In our example this is `P(Pos|D)`. This value is given to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting our values into the formula for Bayes theorem we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "`P(D|Pos) = P(D) * P(Pos|D) / P(Pos)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of getting a positive test result `P(Pos)` can be calculated using the Sensitivity and Specificity as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`P(Pos) = [P(D) * Sensitivity] + [P(~D) * (1-Specificity))]`"
